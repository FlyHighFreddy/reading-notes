# Notes to Class 5

Well, I tried to do the reading, and it wasn't jiving with my learning style, so I jumped straight into YouTube:
Here is my [guide video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qhaz36TZG5Y) and it helped me get it more than the readings.
Another [guide video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z4pCqK-V_Wo) that I liked becasue of the way it explained things.
These two videos had a pacing that resonated more and helped me understand the structure of CSS and how the elements stack.
