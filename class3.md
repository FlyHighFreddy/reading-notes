So, I've started the process of utilizing VS Code to edit my site and the Terminal to push the updates. It’s magical. I hope that the farther you go into this process, the less you must memorize all these back-end things. Honestly, I’d think that there is a better way to manage all the commits, but hopefully it will be much better. For now, git add/commit/push is the joy of life.
