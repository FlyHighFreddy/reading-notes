These are just some abbriviated notes from the articles on using the Ubuntu terminal: 

1. The Command Line - A simple way of interacting with multiple tools. Check out [this video](https://youtu.be/I4EWvMFj37g) for more info.
2. Basic Navigation - multiple ways to shorten paths ~ . .. there are benefits to all
3. About Files - Extensions are a myth in Linux,  `file [path]` tells you what it is, say no to the spacebar unless you\ add the symbol that doesn't show, and it's all case sensitive AF. 
4. .theRestIsHidden
