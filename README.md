## This is my Reading Notes Repository

### About me!

_I am a AH-64D üöÅ:Attack Helicopter pilot who intends to leverage coding as a side-hustle. I enjoy aviation photography, and many of my websites will feature my own [PHOTOGRAPHY](https://www.instagram.com/flyhighfreddy/?hl=en) going forward._
